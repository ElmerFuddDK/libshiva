\mainpage SHIVA - Cross platform application framework

\section abstract Introduction

This is the documentation for the shiva gui libraries. GUI in SHIVA
is an abstraction layer on top of some platform specific GUI toolkits.
On Windows CE/Mobile and Windows this is Win32, and on linux it is
so far only GTK. By the time Symbian is re-introduced to SHIVA it
will probably use QT since it is now license compatible with SHIVA.\n
