Building for windows:

You will need to build FreeTDS yourself and place the headers and lib files in
the following directory structures, depending on whether you use mingw or
visual studio:


MinGW:
------
Headers:
 shiva/shivafreetds/windows/freetds/include/*.h
Lib files:
 shiva/shivafreetds/windows/freetds/lib/sybdb*

Visual studio:
--------------
Headers:
 shiva/shivafreetds/windows/freetds-vs/include/*.h
Lib files:
 shiva/shivafreetds/windows/freetds-vs/lib/sybdb*


It is possible to obtain some prebuilt versions for visual studio from here:

Good luck.
